        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          What's the purpose of putting you guys through that nightmare of a
          website? It's twofold.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Time trials such as these are important in usability studies. In
            actual time trials, data would be collected, as well as a balking
            rate.
          </li>
          <li>
            To show that the user experience is paramount in design. If the
            first part of the activity tasked you to buy a dog, it would be
            nearly impossible to do so because the site's so intentionally bad,
            and it's impossible to navigate.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          This second activity is an oversimplification of what you're supposed
          to do; this website follows Fitts law by having that easy to find
          button. I tried to make it look good too, rather than the first site,
          which was intentionally ugly.
        </p>
        <p>
          It took quite a lot of effort to attempt to break every single design
          principle out there, and if you got frustrated, we've achieved our
          goal. We also thought the spam was kinda funny.
        </p>
        <p>
          You could keep reading for a short blurb on design thinking, UX and
          putting everything all together, or you could close this page and move
          on; the activity's over. Thanks for participating!

        <h1>Design Thinking</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Design thinking is both a mindset and process to drive product
          development and innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's a human-centric, user-specific and solution-focused approach to
          problem solving. Rather than focus on creating something "novel", the
          product has to be usable; the user is more important than the product
          and the solution is more important than the problem.
        </p>
        <img src="src/img/design_thinking.png" alt="design thinking" />
        <p class="centered">
          The design thinking process, iterative and non-linear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although there are different models, applying design thinking to a
          project typically looks like:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <u>Empathize:</u> Research users' needs to gain an empathetic
            understanding of the problem, setting aside personal assumptions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Define:</u> Accumulate and analyze information from the Empathize
            stage to define core problems as problem statements and create
            "personas", fictional characters that represent the target user.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Ideate:</u> Generate ideas by thinking outside the box, looking
            for alternative ways to view the problem, and identifying innovative
            solutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Prototype:</u> An experimental phase to identify the best
            possible solution for each problem found, often involving paper
            prototyping or other inexpensive methods.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Test:</u> Rigorously test the prototypes. This phase is
            iterative, allowing for redefining and refining problems and
            solutions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The design process is intended to be iterative and non-linear. These
          stages aren't sequential steps; they could be run in parallel or out
          of order and reflected back upon until a viable solution is found.
        </p>
        <p>
          Design thinking doesn't only have to be applied to shipping products
          either, it can be applied to any problem. The fundementals of focusing
          on the solution and the user can be applied to any problem and can be
          incorporated into any process.
        </p>

      <div id="uiux" class="maintext">
        <h1>User Experience</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          At a macro level, UX (user experience) is the perceptions and
          responses a user has when using a product. This typically applies to
          software such as websites and applications that encompass a user
          interface (UI) but can be applied to any product. Without a good user
          experience, a product's usability is diminished; in the context of
          website design, a user may not be able to find what they're looking
          for, give up and may never return, costing future business. Again,
          creating a good user experience doesn't only apply to websites; the
          same concept of balking applies to any product or service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like design thinking, user experience can also be a user-centric
          mindset, emphasizing the importance of understanding and addressing
          the needs, preferences, and pain points of users throughout the entire
          product or service development process. However, UX isn't really a
          process, but there are processes that can be applied to UX design.
        </p>
        <p>
          UX design is both an art and a science and requires a combination of
          both perspectives to achieve sucess because every descision should be
          rooted within a decision backed by <i>science</i>. The basic
          fundementals of the scientific method are applied to the design
          process.
        </p>
        <img src="src/img/ux_design.png" alt="design flowchat" />
        <p class="centered">Scientific method in UX flowchart.</p>
        <p>
          This looks a little familiar to something we just talked about in the
          <a href="#design_thinking">previous section</a>. Research is the
          cornerstone of UX design; to gain insight into how to design a good
          user experience, the user must be understood. Both qualitative and
          quantitative data can be collected to observe patterns, preferences,
          and behaviors. The <i>why</i> has to also be understood.
        </p>

        <p>
          To tie this back into the activity, we could imagine a scenario where
          the user would like to... buy a dog. That's the problem, research into
          user experience elements and the best way to coerce potential
          customers into checking out can be found online, so you come up with a
          hypothesis, such as "the user will be more likely to buy a dog if the
          website is easy to navigate". A website would then be created and
          tested on users. The feedback from the first activity would obviously
          be negative, so the website would be iterated upon and tested again,
          resulting in a better user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          This activity demonstrates some types of research and experiments used
          in UX. Quantitative experiments include finding the number of clicks
          to navigate the page, likart scales, time studies and more. Time
          trials, such as the one you just partook in, can be used to study
          macro level concepts (Fitts Law, navigation practices, etc.) or to
          prototype a website. Ideally, time trials would be more
          <i>scientifically</i> conducted than this one. While we tend to
          associate lower times with better usability and as the "goal" of a
          website, that may not always be the case; sometimes a website may want
          to keep the user on the page for as long as possible, such as a news
          website that wants to maximize ad revenue by making it difficult to
          navigate.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for qualitative studies, well we went around and showed some people
          this monstronsity and they all cried because they saw God's final gift
          to planet Earth. I'm just kidding, but they all agreed it was a
          horrible experience. More formal qualitative studies would involve
          interviews, focus groups and surveys, but they all have the same goal
          of getting feedback from users, and compiling that data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both quantitative and qualitative results would be compiled and
          iterated over to gain insights into creating the targeted user
          experience. There's such a rabbit hole down the UX design process;
          there's even an entire major here (Experience Design) dedicated to it.
          We can't really cover everything in this seminar, but hopefully you
          got a taste of what UX is and how it's applied and the importance of
          research and scientific understanding.

        <p>
          We saw many comparisions between design thinking and UX design, but we
          think that they should be interconnected, rather than separate
          entities. Rather than having a specific UX design process, the process
          behind design thinking can be applied to UX design.

          Figure from an article that attempts to compare them as processes.
          Grey is UX and white is design thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          By encorporating design thinking into the development of a user
          experience, it can be taken to the next level because they share many
          of the same ideals, such as being user-centric and solution-focused.
          Design thinking adds iteration and non-linearity to UX design, which
          loops over research, design and testing to create a better product.
          Design thinking also holds the user at the center of the process,
          which may be lost in a traditional UX design process; that's how bad
          designs are created.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scientific method in UX design closely mirrors the five "module"
          process seen in design thinking, empathize mirrors research, define
          mirrors ideate and the rest are fairly self-explainatory. Design
          thinking <i>is</i> a scientific method that should be applied to UX
          design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our activity largely focused on the scientific method behind UX; we
          showed one "iteration" of research to collect both qualitative and
          quantitative data. We think that's what the takeaway of the expert
          seminar should've been: to gain an understanding of some of the data
          collection methods used in UX design. However, we largely focused on
          design thinking and UX because there's a lot of confusion between the
          two, and we thought that the wide variety of conflicting opinions that
          we found online was interesting.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be "Design Thinking <i>in</i> UX Design" rather than "Design
          Thinking <i>and</i> UX Design".

          This was a blast to research and make. The two trickiest parts were
          understanding how design thinking played into UX and creating that
          horrible website because the JavaScript was a nightmare to write, but
          it was hard to violate every single design principle out there.
