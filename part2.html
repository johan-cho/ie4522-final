        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          What's the purpose of putting you guys through that nightmare of a
          website? It's twofold.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Time trials such as these are important in usability studies. In
            actual time trials, data would be collected, as well as a balking
            rate. More data, such as the number of clicks, general feedback,
            etc. would also be collected.
          </li>
          <li>
            To show that the user experience is paramount in design. If the
            first part of the activity tasked you to buy a dog, it would be
            nearly impossible to do so because the site's so intentionally bad.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          It took quite a lot of effort to attempt to break every single design
          principle out there, and if you got frustrated, we've achieved our
          goal. We also thought it the website was kinda funny.

        <h1>Design Thinking</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>
          Design thinking is both a mindset and process to drive product
          development and innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's a human-centric, user-specific, solution-focused approach to
          problem solving. Rather than focus on innovation and creating
          something "novel", the product has to be usable; the user is more
          important than the product and the solution is more important than the
          problem.
        </p>

        <img src="src/img/design_thinking.png" alt="design thinking" />

        <p>
          Although there are different models, applying design thinking to a
          project typically looks like:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <u>Empathize:</u> Research users' needs to gain an empathetic
            understanding of the problem, setting aside personal assumptions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Define:</u> Accumulate and analyze information from the Empathize
            stage to define core problems as problem statements and create
            "personas", fictional characters that represent the target user.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Ideate:</u> Generate ideas by thinking outside the box, looking
            for alternative ways to view the problem, and identifying innovative
            solutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Prototype:</u> An experimental phase to identify the best
            possible solution for each problem found, often involving paper
            prototyping or other inexpensive methods.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Test:</u> Rigorously test the prototypes. This phase is
            iterative, allowing for redefining and refining problems and
            solutions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This whole process is intended to be iterative and non-linear. These
          stages aren't sequential steps; they could be run in parallel and
          reflected back upon until a viable solution is found.
        </p>
        <p>
          Design thinking doesn't only have to be applied to shipping products
          either, it can be applied to any problem. The fundementals of focusing
          on the solution and the user can be applied to any problem and can be
          incorporated into any process.

        <h1>User Experience</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          User experience is the process of enhancing user satisfaction by
          improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the
          interaction between the user and the product.
